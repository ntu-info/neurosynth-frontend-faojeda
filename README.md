# Neurosynth Frontend

This is my frontend for week 7's assignment.

It connects to Trenâ€™s backend server to test the three required endpoints using AJAX and Tailwind:

- `/terms`
- `/terms/<t1>`
- `/query/<q>/studies`

The page allows switching between the original and backup servers.  

I used Tailwind for quick styling and vanilla JavaScript for the fetch requests.

---

### How to open it
1. Clone the repo or open the live page.
2. If running locally:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
